The MG-42 general-purpose machine gun was developed and put into service by Nazi Germany in 1942, basically based on the weapon using 7.92×57mm Mauser rifle as the basis of development, and was prepared to replace the MG34 general-purpose machine gun. However, the two machine guns were used together until the end of the war.
